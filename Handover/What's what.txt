###Descriptions of files

data: containing all the data files generated by and needed for the R scripts

##R scripts
get_env_data.R: script for creating environmental and land layers
get_sdm_data.R: script for working with presence/absence data and producing inputs for sdms
run_sdm.R: script for running all sdms
create_RS_inputs.R : script for creating inputs for RangeShiftR simulations (habitat layers and species distributions)
Ischnura_RS.R: script for running RS simulations

##RangeShiftR simulations
Simulation1: static, using 2013 environmental/habitat layer for entire sim
Simulation2: dynamic, using yearly updated habitat layer until 2023

Ischnura write up.docx: detailed methods write up with references etc and explanation for methods used as well as initial results for basic simulations
